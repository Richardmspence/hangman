(onkeyup)

5. is to to get the alert to say the key

when user clicks any key on their keyboard it alerts that key

6. is to store a letter in a variable and if the user hits that key it alerts you win and if the user doesn't hit that key it alerts you lose

7. is instead of alerting you win or you lose, you add that text to the html 

8. is you set up a counter for wins and another for losses 
and you increment both 
and whenever they hit a key you increment either one and replace the text on the page with the new wins or losses
